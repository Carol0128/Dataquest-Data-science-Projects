# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data using SQL
## by Carol Obura

This project presents using SQL in jupyter notebook to gather and analyse data.

The data used is from [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a website that provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.

The following are some of the summary findings the analysis seeks to draw:
- maximum and minimum population and population growth
- countries with the highest birth, death and migration rates
- country with the largest water area in square kilometers

## Findings
From CIA World Factbook:
- Antarctica has the least population, while China has the highest population with 1367485388	people, and population growth of 0.45
- Niger has a very high birth rate, which is even twice higher than the average birth rate of all the countries. This high birth rate is attributed to by the people's desire to have large families, and partly by gender inequality which includes lack of educational opportunities for women, leading to early marriages and childbirth.
- Qatar has the highest migration rate, mostly due to search of employment by people from other countries.

## Conclusion
Using SQL within notebook makes it very easy to interact with databases, and also allows performing calculation of features in the datasets.
